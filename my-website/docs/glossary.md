# Glossary

This glossary provides definitions for key terms used throughout the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook.

## A

### Action
A ROS 2 communication pattern for long-running tasks that provides feedback during execution and allows for cancellation.

## C

### Computer Vision
A field of artificial intelligence that enables computers to interpret and understand visual information from the world.

## D

### Digital Twin
A virtual replica of a physical system that enables testing and validation without requiring the actual hardware.

## G

### Gazebo
A 3D simulation environment for robotics that provides realistic physics and sensor simulation.

## I

### IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)
A sensor that measures specific force, angular rate, and sometimes the magnetic field surrounding the body.

### Isaac
NVIDIA's robotics platform that provides simulation, perception, navigation, and manipulation capabilities optimized for AI.

## N

### Node
A process that performs computation in a ROS system. Nodes are the fundamental building blocks of ROS applications.

## R

### ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)
A flexible framework for writing robotic software that provides hardware abstraction, device drivers, libraries, and tools.

### ROS 2 Topic
A communication channel over which nodes exchange messages in a publish-subscribe pattern.

## S

### SLAM (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping)
A computational problem where a robot builds a map of an unknown environment while simultaneously keeping track of its location within that map.

## U

### URDF (Unified Robot Description Format)
An XML format for representing a robot model including its links, joints, and other properties.

### Unity
A cross-platform game engine that is used for creating 3D environments and simulations for robotics applications.

## V

### VLA (Vision-Language-Action)
A system that combines computer vision, natural language processing, and robotic action to enable natural human-robot interaction.

## W

### Webots
A robot simulation software that provides a complete development environment for fast and accurate robot simulations.
