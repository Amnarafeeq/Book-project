## Why Physical AI Matters

Physical AI represents the convergence of artificial intelligence and robotics, enabling machines to understand, interact with, and manipulate the physical world. Unlike traditional AI systems that operate purely in digital spaces, Physical AI systems must navigate the complexities of real-world physics, sensor limitations, and environmental uncertainties.

### Key Challenges in Physical AI
- **Real-time Processing**: Systems must respond to dynamic environments with minimal latency
- **Embodiment**: Physical constraints and affordances shape AI capabilities
- **Safety**: Ensuring safe interaction between AI systems and humans
- **Transfer Learning**: Bridging the gap between simulation and reality

## What Students Learn

Through this comprehensive course, students will master the complete stack of technologies needed to build intelligent robotic systems:

- **ROS 2**: The standard framework for robotic application development
- **Gazebo & Unity**: Simulation environments for testing and training
- **NVIDIA Isaac**: GPU-accelerated AI for perception, navigation, and manipulation
- **Vision-Language-Action (VLA)**: Multimodal systems for natural human-robot interaction
- **Integration**: Combining all technologies into complete robotic systems

## Hardware Required

The course covers both simulation-based learning and optional physical implementation. Students can progress through the curriculum using simulation environments, with options for hardware integration as resources allow:

- **Digital Twin Workstation**: High-performance computing for simulation
- **Jetson Edge Kit**: For deploying AI algorithms on robotic platforms
- **Robot Platforms**: Various options from educational to research-grade robots
- **Cloud Solutions**: NVIDIA Omniverse and AWS for scalable simulation

## Capstone Overview

The course culminates in a comprehensive capstone project where students integrate all learned technologies into an autonomous humanoid robot system. The capstone demonstrates:

- **Voice Command Processing**: Natural language understanding and task decomposition
- **Autonomous Navigation**: SLAM-based navigation in dynamic environments
- **Object Detection and Manipulation**: Computer vision and robotic manipulation
- **System Integration**: Complete ROS 2 + Isaac + VLA integration
