# Module 1: Introduction to ROS 2

## 1.2 URDF & ROS 2 Overview Outline

This section will provide a high-level overview of URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) and its integral role within the ROS 2 ecosystem. It will cover the basic structure of a URDF file, its purpose in describing robot kinematics, visual properties, and collision models, and how ROS 2 utilizes this information for simulation, visualization, and motion planning.

### Key Topics:

- **What is URDF?**
    - Purpose: Describing robot geometry, kinematics, and physical properties.
    - XML-based format.
- **Core URDF Elements:**
    - **`<link>`:** Defines rigid bodies of the robot.
        - `visual`: Appearance (geometry, material).
        - `collision`: Physical properties for collision detection.
        - `inertial`: Mass, center of mass, inertia tensor.
    - **`<joint>`:** Connects two links, defining their kinematic relationship.
        - `parent` and `child` links.
        - `type`: revolute, prismatic, fixed, continuous, planar, floating.
        - `origin`: position and orientation of the joint.
        - `axis`: rotation or translation axis for non-fixed joints.
        - `limit`: joint limits (e.g., range for revolute/prismatic).
    - **`<robot>`:** The root element encapsulating all links and joints.
- **ROS 2 Integration with URDF:**
    - **`robot_state_publisher`:** Publishes the robot's joint states and transforms.
    - **`joint_state_publisher`:** Publishes sensor_msgs/JointState messages based on URDF and joint values.
    - **RViz2:** Visualization tool for displaying URDF models, sensor data, and robot states.
    - **Gazebo:** Physics simulator that can load and simulate URDF models.
- **Benefits of URDF in ROS 2:**
    - Standardized robot description.
    - Enables simulation and visualization.
    - Facilitates communication between different ROS 2 packages (e.g., motion planning, inverse kinematics).

### Illustrative Diagrams:

- **URDF to RViz2 Flow:** A diagram illustrating how a URDF file is processed by `robot_state_publisher` and then visualized in RViz2.
