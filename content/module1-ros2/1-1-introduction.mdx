# Module 1: Introduction to ROS 2

## 1.1 Introduction

Welcome to Module 1: Introduction to ROS 2. This module serves as your gateway into the powerful and flexible world of the Robot Operating System 2. Developed to address the evolving needs of modern robotics, ROS 2 is a set of software libraries and tools that help you build robot applications. From research and prototyping to deployment in production environments, ROS 2 provides a standardized communication infrastructure, development tools, and a rich ecosystem of packages and algorithms.

The first generation of ROS (ROS 1) revolutionized robotics development by offering a standardized framework for diverse hardware and software components. However, with the increasing demands for real-time performance, security, and multi-robot systems, a re-architecture was necessary. ROS 2 was born from this necessity, bringing significant improvements in areas such as:

- **Quality of Service (QoS) Policies:** Enabling developers to define specific requirements for data reliability, latency, and throughput, crucial for real-time applications.
- **Support for Multiple DDS Implementations:** DDS (Data Distribution Service) is the underlying communication middleware for ROS 2, offering robust, high-performance, and scalable data exchange.
- **Enhanced Security Features:** Incorporating mechanisms for authentication, encryption, and access control to protect robot systems from unauthorized access and tampering.
- **Improved Multi-Robot Support:** Designed from the ground up to handle multiple robots operating in the same environment, facilitating coordinated behaviors and swarm robotics.
- **Windows, macOS, and RTOS Compatibility:** Expanding the reach of ROS to a wider range of operating systems, including real-time operating systems essential for industrial applications.

This module will guide you through the core concepts of ROS 2, starting with its fundamental architectural components. You will learn how ROS 2 organizes software into nodes, how these nodes communicate via topics, services, and actions, and how to utilize the command-line tools for introspection and debugging. A significant portion of this module is dedicated to hands-on exercises, ensuring that you not only understand the theoretical underpinnings but also gain practical experience in building and interacting with ROS 2 applications.

We will delve into the creation of Uniform Robot Description Format (URDF) models, which are essential for describing the kinematic and dynamic properties of your robot, as well as its visual and collision characteristics. Understanding URDF is crucial for simulating your robot in environments like Gazebo and visualizing its state in tools like RViz2. Furthermore, this module will cover the integration of sensor data into your ROS 2 ecosystem, focusing on how to process and interpret information from devices such as depth cameras (e.g., Intel RealSense).

By the end of this module, you should be able to:
- Articulate the key differences and advantages of ROS 2 over ROS 1.
- Implement basic ROS 2 communication patterns (publishers, subscribers, clients, servers).
- Create and interpret URDF models for robot description.
- Integrate simulated sensor data into a ROS 2 application.
- Utilize essential ROS 2 command-line tools for development and debugging.
- Understand the considerations for deploying ROS 2 applications on embedded hardware like the NVIDIA Jetson Orin.

This journey into ROS 2 is designed to equip you with the foundational knowledge and practical skills necessary to embark on more complex robotics projects. Let's begin!
